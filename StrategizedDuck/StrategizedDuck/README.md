## This is a Duck class example from Head First Design Pattern.
It uses strategy design pattern for this example. In this pattern, we're breaking down behaviour and programing to interface and not implementation.
The strategy pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and make them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
The classes associated to the Duck interface are modified at runtime making it flexible and loosely coupled.

The LLD Diagram of the class can be found below :
